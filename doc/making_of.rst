The making of of a generic library
==================================

There already exists lots of libraries that provide various sets of containers
for Ada. Why, then, provide yet another one ?

This chapter describes how the usual containers have a very limited genericity,
which limits their actual reuse or configurability. It also describes how we
ended up with the current design, and how this design provides a much better
control.
